# Arduino Interpreter Numeric Value Display Fix

This patch fixes an issue where the Arduino Interpreter was displaying symbolic names (HIGH/LOW, INPUT/OUTPUT) instead of numeric values (1/0, 1/0) in the command output.

## Problem

The interpreter was correctly processing numeric values internally, but the display logic in both the interpreter and the playground was converting these back to symbolic names for display purposes, causing confusion.

## Changes Made

### 1. ArduinoInterpreter.js
Fixed two functions to ensure numeric values are properly handled:
- `arduinoPinMode`: Now stores and emits the numeric mode value instead of the symbolic name
- `arduinoDigitalWrite`: Now stores and emits the numeric value instead of the symbolic name

### 2. interpreter_playground.html
Modified the `displayCommand` function to show actual numeric values instead of converting them to symbolic names:
- `PIN_MODE` commands now show `pinMode(pin, mode)` where mode is numeric (0, 1, 2)
- `DIGITAL_WRITE` commands now show `digitalWrite(pin, value)` where value is numeric (0, 1)

## Before and After

Before:
```
pinMode(13, OUTPUT)
digitalWrite(13, HIGH)
digitalWrite(13, LOW)
```

After:
```
pinMode(13, 1)
digitalWrite(13, 1)
digitalWrite(13, 0)
```

## Applying the Patch

To apply this patch, use:
```bash
patch -p1 < accurate_complete_fix.patch
```

Or manually edit the files according to the changes shown in the patch file.

## Verification

After applying the patch, you can verify the fix by:
1. Running the interpreter playground
2. Executing code with digitalWrite and pinMode commands
3. Observing that the output shows numeric values instead of symbolic names
