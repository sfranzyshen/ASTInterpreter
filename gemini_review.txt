Of course. I've analyzed your project files and the detailed bug report. The report's conclusion is correct: the issue is a critical bug in the JavaScript export logic, not the C++ import.

The root cause is in the writeNode function in CompactAST.js. The existing logic attempts a series of checks to find a value to write for a node. For UnaryOpNode and BinaryOpNode, these checks fail, causing the code to hit a fallback case that explicitly writes an empty string "" as the operator's value.

Even though the HAS_VALUE flag is correctly set and the string table contains the right operators, the value written into the node's data section is an index pointing to an empty string.

The Fix: Correcting CompactAST.js
To fix this, you need to modify the writeNode function in CompactAST.js to specifically handle UnaryOpNode and BinaryOpNode and ensure it extracts the operator from the node.op.value field.

Here is the corrected code block.

File: CompactAST.js
Function: writeNode

Original (Buggy) Code:
JavaScript

        // Write value if present (node.value takes precedence over node.operator/node.op)
        if (node.value !== undefined) {
            offset = this.writeValue(view, offset, node.value);
        } else if (node.operator !== undefined) {
            // Write operator as a regular string value for C++ compatibility
            offset = this.writeValue(view, offset, node.operator);
        } else if (node.op && node.op.value !== undefined) {
            // Write op.value for BinaryOpNode and UnaryOpNode for C++ compatibility
            offset = this.writeValue(view, offset, node.op.value);
        } else if (node.type === 'UnaryOpNode' || node.type === 'BinaryOpNode') {
            // Fallback: Force empty string for operator nodes if no operator found
            // This ensures HAS_VALUE flag consistency
            offset = this.writeValue(view, offset, "");
        }
Corrected Code:
Replace the block above with the following more robust logic. This new structure prioritizes the specific format of operator nodes before checking for other value types.

JavaScript

        // Write value if present. Operator nodes have a special structure.
        if (node.type === 'UnaryOpNode' || node.type === 'BinaryOpNode') {
            // For operator nodes, the value is guaranteed to be in node.op.value
            if (node.op && typeof node.op.value === 'string') {
                offset = this.writeValue(view, offset, node.op.value);
            } else {
                // This is a safeguard. If HAS_VALUE is set, a value MUST be written.
                // An empty string preserves the format, but indicates a problem with the JS AST.
                console.warn(`Operator node is missing 'op.value'. Writing empty string.`);
                offset = this.writeValue(view, offset, ""); 
            }
        } else if (node.value !== undefined) {
            // Handle standard value nodes
            offset = this.writeValue(view, offset, node.value);
        } else if (node.operator !== undefined) {
            // Handle other potential structures that use 'operator' field
            offset = this.writeValue(view, offset, node.operator);
        }
Why This Works
Prioritizes Operator Nodes: The new code first checks if the node is a UnaryOpNode or BinaryOpNode. This prevents the logic from falling through to incorrect checks.

Correct Field Access: It now correctly and reliably reads the operator string from node.op.value, which matches the logic used in the collectNodes function that builds the string table.

Eliminates the Fallback: It removes the faulty else if condition that was forcing an empty string to be written for all operator nodes.

Your C++ code in CompactAST.cpp is correctly implemented to handle the HAS_VALUE flag and read a STRING_VAL from the data stream. Once you apply the JavaScript fix and regenerate your .ast binary files, the C++ parser will correctly read the operator string index, look it up in the string table, and assign it to the node. This will resolve the "Unknown binary operator" errors.
