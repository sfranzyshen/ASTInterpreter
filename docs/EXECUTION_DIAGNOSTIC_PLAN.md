# C++ Execution Engine Diagnostic & Fix Plan

## Problem Statement
C++ interpreter generates only 36 commands vs JavaScript's 2,498 commands (1.4% success rate).
THEPLAN.md assumed 85% completion but the fundamental execution engine is broken.

**Estimated Total Effort: 20-40 hours of systematic debugging**

---

## Phase 1: Execution Flow Diagnostic (4-6 hours)

### 1A: Create Execution Tracing System (2 hours)
**Goal**: Track exactly where C++ execution diverges from JavaScript

**Implementation**:
```cpp
// Add to ASTInterpreter.hpp
class ExecutionTracer {
    std::vector<std::string> trace;
    bool enabled = true;
    
public:
    void log(const std::string& event, const std::string& detail = "");
    void compareWithJS(const std::vector<std::string>& jsTrace);
    void saveToFile(const std::string& filename);
};
```

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add TRACE() macro throughout C++ interpreter 
- [ ] Instrument all visitor methods with entry/exit logging
- [ ] Instrument expression evaluation with detailed parameter logging
- [ ] Create matching JavaScript trace generation
- [ ] Generate comparative trace files for simple test case

### 1B: Minimal Test Case Analysis (2 hours) 
**Goal**: Start with simplest possible divergence

**Test Cases**:
1. `void setup() { int x = 5; } void loop() { }`
2. `void setup() { digitalWrite(13, HIGH); } void loop() { }`
3. `void setup() { Serial.print("Hello"); } void loop() { }`

**Expected Outcome**: Identify exactly which visitor method or expression type is failing first

### 1C: Command Generation Audit (2 hours)
**Goal**: Verify command emission pipeline

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add command emission logging with stack traces
- [ ] Verify emitCommand() is being called from expression evaluation
- [ ] Check if VAR_SET, FUNCTION_CALL commands are properly generated
- [ ] Compare command generation points between JS and C++

---

## Phase 2: Expression Evaluation Deep Fix (8-12 hours)

### 2A: Expression Evaluation Flow Analysis (3 hours)
**Goal**: Fix the expression → command generation chain

**Suspected Issues**:
- `evaluateExpression()` may not be called from statement visitors
- Expression results may not trigger command emission
- Assignment/function call expressions may return values but not emit commands

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Trace `visit(ExpressionStatement&)` → `evaluateExpression()` flow
- [ ] Verify `evaluateExpression()` actually gets called for each expression
- [ ] Check if expression evaluation results in command emission
- [ ] Fix broken expression evaluation chains

### 2B: Variable Declaration & Assignment Fix (3 hours)
**Goal**: Ensure variable operations generate commands

**Focus Areas**:
- `visit(VarDeclNode&)` - Does it emit commands?
- `visit(AssignmentNode&)` - We added VAR_SET emission but is it reached?
- Variable initialization expressions

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add detailed logging to VarDeclNode visitor
- [ ] Verify AssignmentNode visitor is actually called
- [ ] Fix variable declaration command emission
- [ ] Test with simple `int x = 5;` scenarios

### 2C: Function Call Expression Fix (3 hours)
**Goal**: Ensure Arduino function calls generate commands

**Focus Areas**:
- `visit(FuncCallNode&)` → `executeArduinoFunction()` chain
- Command emission from Arduino functions
- Function call result handling

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Trace digitalWrite(13, HIGH) execution path
- [ ] Verify executeArduinoFunction() emits PIN_MODE, DIGITAL_WRITE commands
- [ ] Fix function call expression evaluation
- [ ] Test with simple Arduino function calls

### 2D: Statement Execution Flow (3 hours)
**Goal**: Ensure statements inside function bodies execute

**Focus Areas**:
- `visit(CompoundStmtNode&)` - Are child statements processed?
- `visit(ExpressionStatement&)` - Are expressions evaluated?
- Statement visitor dispatch

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add detailed logging to CompoundStmtNode
- [ ] Verify all child statements are visited
- [ ] Fix statement dispatch issues
- [ ] Test with multiple statements in setup()

---

## Phase 3: Control Flow & Function Body Execution (4-6 hours)

### 3A: Function Body Execution Fix (2 hours)
**Goal**: Ensure setup()/loop() body contents execute

**Suspected Issues**:
- Function body visitor may not process statements
- Scope management may interfere with execution
- Function execution may exit early

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Trace executeSetup() → function body execution
- [ ] Verify function body AST nodes are visited
- [ ] Fix function body statement processing
- [ ] Test with multi-statement setup() functions

### 3B: Control Flow Statement Fix (2 hours)
**Goal**: Ensure if/for/while statements execute their bodies

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Fix IfStatement body execution
- [ ] Fix ForStatement/WhileStatement iteration
- [ ] Verify control flow condition evaluation
- [ ] Test with conditional Arduino code

### 3C: Scope and Context Management (2 hours) 
**Goal**: Ensure proper variable and function scope

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk Areas**:
- Expression evaluation architecture may need redesign
- Visitor pattern dispatch may have fundamental flaws
- Command emission pipeline may need refactoring

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Start with smallest possible test cases
- Fix one layer at a time with validation
- Be prepared to refactor core execution architecture if needed
- Consider hybrid approach: keep what works, rebuild what doesn't

**Time Box**: 40 hours maximum. If not resolved by then, consider architectural alternatives.

## Next Actions

1. **Start with Phase 1A**: Create execution tracing system
2. **Choose minimal test case**: `int x = 5;` assignment
3. **Generate comparative traces**: JavaScript vs C++ execution paths
4. **Begin systematic fix**: One diagnostic finding at a time
